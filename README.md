# Human-Stress-Detection-Based-On-Sleeping-Habits-Using-Machine-learning-Algorithms
This project uses machine learning to detect stress levels based on a person's sleep patterns. By analyzing sleep duration, quality, and other factors, the model predicts whether someone might be stressed. The goal is to help people better understand how their sleep affects their stress levels.
