# Human Stress Detection Based on Sleeping Habits Using Machine Learning Algorithms

## Overview
This project aims to detect human stress levels based on sleeping habits using various machine learning algorithms. By analyzing sleep patterns, heart rate, and other relevant parameters, the model predicts stress levels, helping individuals manage their well-being.

## Features
- Data collection and preprocessing of sleep-related parameters.
- Implementation of multiple machine learning models for stress detection.
- Visualization of stress trends based on sleeping habits.
- Performance evaluation and comparison of models.
